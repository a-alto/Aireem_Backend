Project made for the High School Graduation Exam (Technical Institute - Computer Science).

In the beginning, I went through a brainstorming phase in which I analyzed the current historical and social context in order to make something which could have been useful in terms of an ever-increasing market demand still not adequately satisfied.
This phase eventually led me to the final decision of what I was going to realize.

The web application I made lets registered users offer on-demand jobs by making their skills available to the public and allows other people to request services which they need, by putting them in contact with the professionals.

First of all, I worked on Project Management-related matters like Envisioning and Branding, thus laying down the foundations for my startup (Mission, Vision, and Values), choosing the name, and designing the logo.

So I developed the web app from scratch, realizing the database, the back-end script, and the user interface (front-end).
The last step was to deploy the app on a hosting service in order to make it available to use.
